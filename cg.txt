First, let us please understand, the question is an open-ended one with no binary or multiclass
 answers, as “Analyst” in CG is a designation from the hierarchy than a role. Following being the 
hierarchical structure:

A3 - Associate
A4 - Analyst
A5 - Senior Analyst
B1 - Associate Consultant
B2 - Consultant
C1 - Senior Consultant
C2 - Manager
D1 - Senior Manager
D2 - Program Manager
E1- Director
So, whatever be your BU (Business Unit) / LoS (Line of Service), the designation remains the 
same across the length and breadth of the org. In general, B.Tech graduates enter as Analysts 
(previously Software Engineer).
