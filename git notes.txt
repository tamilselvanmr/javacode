Git remote and add ssh key to access your git repositories.
===========================================================

Open Git Bash.
--------------
1. Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

	$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
	
	Note: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:
	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
	
	This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.

	> Generating public/private algorithm key pair.
	When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

	> Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_algorithm):[Press enter]
	At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases."

	> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
	> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

2. Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key.
If you have GitHub Desktop installed, you can use it to clone repositories and not deal with SSH keys.

Ensure the ssh-agent is running. You can use the "Auto-launching the ssh-agent" instructions in "Working with SSH key passphrases", or start it manually:

	# start the ssh-agent in the background
	$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	> Agent pid 59566
	
Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name,
 or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.
	$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519


3. Add the SSH key to your account on GitHub.
   
    3.1 Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.

		If your SSH public key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key,
		don't add any newlines or whitespace.
		$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
		# Copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard

	3.2 In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, 
	then click Settings.
	
	3.3 In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  SSH and GPG keys.

	3.4 Click New SSH key or Add SSH key.
	3.5 In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. 
	    For example, if you're using a personal laptop, you might call this key "Personal laptop".

	3.6 Select the type of key, either authentication or signing. 
	    For more information about commit signing, see "About commit signature verification."

	3.7 Paste your key into the "Key" field.
	3.8 Click Add SSH key.
